# WolvESpoweR - Power calculations for the WolvES application


## General setup 

We simulated data for 20 wolves at 10 different locations. Sample size
is equally distributed over these (potentially) 200 animals (some will
be unsampled at low overall sampling sizes).

## Sex data

We simulated sampling of either male or female prey and set the
variation between wolf individuals to 1.3-fold (rate ratio). 



The results show...
